<p align="center">A Summary of my Internships</p>
<div align="left"> <p style="padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%;">┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Software Developer Intern @ University of Illinois – Urbana Champaign │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
• Created train, and fine-tuned transformer-based language model and OpenAI GPT-3 to write and grade papers according to a given rubric. Our model graded unseen papers with a 93% accuracy.
• Pre-processed and standardized training data from various essay sources to enhance model performance.
• Developed an interactive frontend interface using React to visualize the results of the assessment and generation models.


┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Software Developer @ Ernst & Young │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
• Commissioned by Ernst & Young, to research and develop novel stock options pricing methods using Quantum Computing.
• Implemented state of the art options pricing models such as Black Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations for quantum computing using Qiskit. Researched the effectiveness of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for options pricing accuracy and developed a Quantum Finance API for future development.
• Packaged our models into an API for future development.


┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Software Engineering & Machine Learning Intern @ NE Quest │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
• Programmed a Machine Learning pipeline using TensorFlow and OpenCV to calculate the likelihood of diseases in observed patients. Cleaned and normalized data collected through experimental testing on patients to be used for creating the model.
• Digitized an algorithm in Python for the neurological Clock and Spiral test used by doctors to detect dementia in patients. My algorithm is currently deployed on the NE Quest app on the app store.
• Designed and programmed a front-end using React for intuitive interaction with the neurological test.


┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Big Data Intern @ Algoscale Technologies │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
• Translated the framework of Big Data projects from Apache Storm to Apache Spark increasing server efficiency and improving fault tolerance for moving into production.
• Ensured that all projects interacted smoothly with HBase, Hadoop and Apache Zookeeper after translation.
• Completed training in Machine/Deep Learning Theory and Big Data Technologies.


┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Deep Learning Researcher @ Emory University │		<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10691" target="_blank"><u>Arxiv</u></a>
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
• Create a Generative Adversarial Network that can produce images of cancerous tissue for further research on rare cancers.
• Researched the effectiveness of augmenting datasets of rare cancers using Generative Adversarial Networks for tumor detection.
• Designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline using TensorFlow on Google Cloud Services to produce microscale images of cancerous tissue for increasing size of Cancer Datasets. My model improved interpretation of rare cancer types by 73%.</p>
